## General
This is just a CIA shortcut that opens Gateway Launcher.

## Building
- Install devkitPro with devkitARM r45 (minimum version)
- Ensure devkitPro\devkitARM\bin is in your system path.
- Type "make"

##Usage
- Place gate.3dsx and Gateway_cia.cia onto the root of your SD card.
- Create the folder SD:/Cia_shortcut/
- Inside the Payloads folder, copy the Gateway_cia.bin according to your 3DS type, region and firmware. Paste it inside the Cia_shortcut folder.
- Install Gateway_cia.cia on your sysNAND with your .cia manager of choice, then run it.
- You may delete Gateway_cia.cia from your SD card if you wish.

## NOTES
- You must launch Gateway using the native_firm from 9.0~9.2. This is a limitation of Gateway, not this tool.
- To do this using AuReiNand, hold **L** when powering on with the proper firmware90.bin in your **aurei** folder.
